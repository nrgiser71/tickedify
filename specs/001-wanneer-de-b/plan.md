# Implementation Plan: Abonnement Selectie Scherm voor Bèta Overgang

**Branch**: `001-wanneer-de-b` | **Date**: 2025-01-21 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-wanneer-de-b/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Create subscription selection screen for beta users when beta period ends, showing three options (14-day trial, monthly €7, yearly €70). Screen must be reusable for new users and only handle UI selection (no payment processing initially). Technical approach will be web-based UI integration with existing Tickedify application.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js >=16.0.0, JavaScript ES6+, HTML5, CSS3
**Primary Dependencies**: Express.js 4.18.2, PostgreSQL (via pg 8.11.3), vanilla JavaScript frontend
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database with existing user and subscription tables
**Testing**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: No visible test framework in package.json]
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox), Vercel hosting
**Project Type**: web - existing Express.js backend with vanilla JS frontend
**Performance Goals**: Standard web performance, <2s page load, smooth UI interactions
**Constraints**: Must integrate with existing beta transition logic, reusable design
**Scale/Scope**: Small feature addition, ~3-5 new files, single subscription screen

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution file**: Template not yet configured for this project
**Default principles applied**:
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Single screen addition, minimal complexity
- ✅ **Integration**: Builds on existing authentication and user management
- ✅ **Reusability**: Designed for both beta transition and new user onboarding
- ✅ **Progressive enhancement**: UI-only initially, payment processing later
- ✅ **No breaking changes**: Additive feature to existing system

**Initial Assessment**: PASS - No constitutional violations detected

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Existing Express.js backend with HTML/CSS/JS frontend

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Database migration task → Add subscription columns to users table
- Contract test tasks → API endpoint validation tests [P]
- Frontend tasks → subscription.html, subscription.js, CSS styling [P]
- Backend tasks → Express.js API endpoints implementation
- Integration tasks → Connect subscription page to beta transition flow

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before API implementation
- Dependency order: Database schema → Backend API → Frontend UI → Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where files are independent
- Frontend files (HTML/CSS/JS) can be developed in parallel [P]
- API endpoints can be developed in parallel after database migration [P]

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Database Tasks** (1 task): Migration script for subscription columns
2. **Contract Test Tasks** (3 tasks): One per API endpoint [P]
3. **Backend API Tasks** (3 tasks): Implement subscription endpoints [P]
4. **Frontend UI Tasks** (4 tasks): HTML page, JavaScript logic, CSS styling, form handling [P]
5. **Integration Tasks** (2 tasks): Beta transition hook, URL routing
6. **Validation Tasks** (2 tasks): Manual testing, quickstart execution

**Estimated Output**: 15-18 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
