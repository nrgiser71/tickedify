## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Tickedify user, when I select multiple tasks and open the bulk edit properties screen, I want to see all interface elements in English so that the application language is consistent throughout and matches my language preference settings.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has selected multiple tasks, **When** they click the bulk edit button, **Then** the bulk edit properties modal opens with all labels, buttons, and instructions in English
2. **Given** the bulk edit properties modal is open, **When** the user interacts with dropdown menus and input fields, **Then** all placeholder text, options, and helper text are displayed in English
3. **Given** the user performs a bulk edit action, **When** the system provides feedback (success/error messages), **Then** all feedback messages are displayed in English
4. **Given** the bulk edit properties modal contains form validation, **When** validation errors occur, **Then** all error messages are displayed in English

### Edge Cases
- What happens when form validation fails? ’ Error messages must be in English
- How does the system handle empty selections or invalid inputs? ’ All feedback must be in English
- Are there any tooltips or help text? ’ These must also be translated to English

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
