-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an admin managing system messages, I need to preview how a message will appear to end users before publishing it, so I can verify the formatting, content, and visual appearance without needing to publish first.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing the message list in admin2.html, **When** I click the preview button on any message row, **Then** I see a preview of how that message will appear to end users

2. **Given** I am viewing the detail screen of a specific message, **When** I click the preview button, **Then** I see a preview of how that message will appear to end users

3. **Given** I am previewing a message, **When** the preview is displayed, **Then** it shows the message with the correct styling for its type (info/warning/feature)

4. **Given** I am viewing a message preview, **When** I want to close the preview, **Then** I can close it and return to my previous view (list or detail)

5. **Given** I have made edits to a message in the detail screen, **When** I click preview, **Then** I see the preview with my current edits (even if not yet saved)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when previewing a message with empty content?
- What happens when previewing a message with very long text?
- How does the preview handle messages with special characters or HTML entities?
- Can the user interact with the preview (e.g., close button in preview) or is it read-only?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a preview button in the message list view (admin2.html messages screen)

- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a preview button in the message detail view (admin2.html message detail screen)

- **FR-003**: Preview button MUST be clearly labeled and easily discoverable in both views

- **FR-004**: When preview button is clicked, system MUST display the message in the same format and styling as end users will see it

- **FR-005**: Preview MUST show the message type indicator (info/warning/feature badge) as it appears to end users

- **FR-006**: Preview MUST show the message title and body content with correct formatting

- **FR-007**: Preview display MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: modal popup, inline expansion, separate preview pane, or new tab/window?]

- **FR-008**: User MUST be able to close the preview and return to their previous view

- **FR-009**: In detail view, preview MUST reflect current unsaved edits to show real-time changes

- **FR-010**: Preview MUST handle empty or missing content gracefully without errors

- **FR-011**: Preview MUST render markdown or formatted text if used in messages [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: do messages support markdown/HTML formatting?]

### Key Entities

- **Message**: Represents a system message with attributes including:
  - Title (text shown as heading)
  - Body/Content (main message text)
  - Type (info, warning, feature)
  - Visual styling rules based on type
  - Current state (draft/published)

- **Preview Instance**: Temporary view showing how a message will appear:
  - Renders message content using end-user styling
  - Shows type badge and formatting
  - Reflects current message state (including unsaved edits in detail view)
  - Does not persist or create database records
