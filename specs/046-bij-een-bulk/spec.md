# Feature Specification: Bulk Edit Translation to English

**Feature Branch**: `046-bij-een-bulk`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Bij een bulk edit verschijnen er onderaan een aantal knoppen. Daar is nog niet alles naar het Engels vertaald. Er staat nog 'Opvolgen' en de dagen van de week zijn ook allemaal in het Nederlands. Vertaal dat naar het Engels."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature identified: Translation of Dutch text to English in bulk edit interface
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Users performing bulk edits
   ’ Actions: Viewing and interacting with bulk edit buttons
   ’ Data: Button labels and day-of-week names
   ’ Constraints: Must be in English (currently mixed Dutch/English)
3. No unclear aspects identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User opens bulk edit, views buttons in English
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable by visual inspection
6. No new entities involved (existing UI elements only)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details included
   ’ Clear and testable requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When a user selects multiple tasks and opens the bulk edit interface, they see action buttons at the bottom of the interface. Currently, some of these buttons and labels are still in Dutch ("Opvolgen" and day-of-week names), while the rest of the application is in English. Users expect all interface elements to be consistently in English.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has selected multiple tasks, **When** they open the bulk edit interface, **Then** all button labels are displayed in English
2. **Given** the bulk edit interface is open, **When** the user views day-of-week options (if present), **Then** all day names are displayed in English (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.)
3. **Given** the bulk edit interface is open, **When** the user views the "Opvolgen" button, **Then** it displays the English equivalent

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the interface language is changed in the future? (Currently not applicable - app is English-only)
- Are there any other untranslated elements in the bulk edit interface beyond "Opvolgen" and day names?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the "Opvolgen" button label in English in the bulk edit interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all day-of-week names in English (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) in the bulk edit interface
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain consistent English language across all bulk edit interface elements
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality of the buttons when translating labels

### Key Entities
No new entities - this feature only affects existing UI text labels in the bulk edit interface.
