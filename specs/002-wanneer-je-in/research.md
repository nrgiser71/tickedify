# Research: Taak Afwerken vanuit Planning Popup

## Testing Strategy Research

### Decision: Extend Existing TestRunner System
**Rationale**: Tickedify already has a comprehensive custom testing infrastructure that perfectly fits the project's needs:
- Custom TestRunner class with automatic test data cleanup
- Test dashboard at `/test-dashboard.html` with visual feedback
- Database integrity and API endpoint testing
- Real production database testing with cleanup

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Jest/Mocha Framework**: Rejected - Overkill for single-user app, would require mocking/stubbing vs real database testing
- **Playwright for UI**: Considered but deferred - Current backend API testing covers core functionality, manual testing sufficient for UI interactions
- **No Testing**: Rejected - Feature affects core task completion workflow

### Decision: Performance Goals = Standard Web Responsiveness
**Rationale**: As a single-user productivity application, standard web app performance expectations apply:
- Form interactions <100ms response time
- API calls <300ms for completion actions
- UI state changes feel immediate to user

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **High-performance targets**: Unnecessary for productivity app scale
- **No performance requirements**: Risky for user experience

## Technical Implementation Research

### Decision: Leverage Existing Planning Popup Infrastructure
**Rationale**: The feature extends existing planning popup functionality rather than creating new components:
- Checkbox integrates with existing form validation system
- Button text change leverages existing UI patterns
- Completion workflow reuses existing task status management

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Separate completion modal**: Rejected - Would fragment user experience
- **Context menu option**: Rejected - Less discoverable than checkbox in popup

### Decision: Maintain Existing Database Schema
**Rationale**: Feature uses existing task completion workflow:
- No new database columns required
- Reuses existing task status transitions (inbox â†’ afgewerkt)
- Preserves existing recurring task logic

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **New completion tracking fields**: Unnecessary complexity
- **Separate completion table**: Over-engineering for simple status change

## Frontend Implementation Patterns

### Decision: Vanilla JavaScript with Existing App.js Patterns
**Rationale**: Consistent with project's technology choices:
- No framework dependencies to maintain
- Follows existing event handling patterns
- Integrates with current validation system

**Research Findings**:
- Project uses vanilla JavaScript with class-based organization
- Event handling through addEventListener patterns
- Form validation with custom validation functions
- Modal/popup management through existing modal system

## API Integration Patterns

### Decision: Extend Existing Task Management Endpoints
**Rationale**: Reuse proven patterns for task operations:
- Leverage existing PUT `/api/taak/:id` for task updates
- Use existing completion workflow for recurring tasks
- Maintain compatibility with current error handling

**Research Findings**:
- Express.js REST API with PostgreSQL backend
- Session-based authentication for single user
- Existing task status management via lijst field
- Proven recurring task creation logic for completed tasks

## UI/UX Integration Research

### Decision: Follow Existing Tickedify Design Patterns
**Rationale**: Maintain consistent user experience:
- Checkbox styling matches existing form elements
- Button text changes follow current pattern conventions
- Modal behavior consistent with other popups

**Research Findings**:
- macOS-style design system with blue accent colors
- Consistent button styling and hover states
- Modal centering and backdrop patterns established
- Toast notification system for user feedback
