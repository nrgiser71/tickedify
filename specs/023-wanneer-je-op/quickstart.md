# Quickstart: Duplicate Submit Prevention Testing

**Feature**: 023-wanneer-je-op
**Purpose**: Manual testing procedure to verify duplicate task submission prevention
**Prerequisite**: Implementation complete, deployed to staging or local environment

## Test Environment Setup

1. **Navigate to application**:
   - Staging: `https://dev.tickedify.com/app`
   - Production (after deploy): `https://tickedify.com/app`
   - Local: `http://localhost:3000` (if running locally)

2. **Login**:

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ **PASS**: Only ONE task "Test rapid enter presses" appears in the inbox list
‚úÖ **PASS**: Input field is cleared after submission
‚úÖ **PASS**: Loading overlay appeared briefly during submission
‚úÖ **PASS**: "Toevoegen" button showed disabled state during submission

‚ùå **FAIL**: Multiple duplicate tasks appear (2 or more)
‚ùå **FAIL**: No task appears
‚ùå **FAIL**: Error message appears

### Cleanup:
- Delete the test task: Click the task ‚Üí click "Verwijderen" button in popup

---

## Test Scenario 2: Rapid Button Clicks

**Objective**: Verify that clicking the "Toevoegen" button multiple times in quick succession only creates one task

### Steps:
1. Click in the task input field at the top of the Inbox
2. Type: `Test rapid button clicks`
3. **Rapidly click the "Toevoegen" button 5 times** within 1 second
4. Wait for loading indicator to disappear (1-2 seconds)

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ **PASS**: Only ONE task "Test rapid button clicks" appears in the inbox list
‚úÖ **PASS**: Input field is cleared after submission

‚úÖ **PASS**: Loading overlay appeared briefly during submission

‚ùå **FAIL**: Multiple duplicate tasks appear (2 or more)
‚ùå **FAIL**: No task appears
‚ùå **FAIL**: Button remained clickable during submission

### Cleanup:

## Test Scenario 3: Mixed Enter + Button Clicks

**Objective**: Verify that alternating between Enter presses and button clicks only creates one task

### Steps:
1. Click in the task input field at the top of the Inbox

3. **Alternate rapidly** (within 1 second total):
   - Press Enter
   - Click "Toevoegen" button
   - Press Enter again
   - Click "Toevoegen" button again
4. Wait for loading indicator to disappear (1-2 seconds)

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ **PASS**: Only ONE task "Test mixed submit methods" appears in the inbox list
‚úÖ **PASS**: Input field is cleared after submission
‚úÖ **PASS**: Both Enter and button were blocked after first submission
‚úÖ **PASS**: Loading overlay appeared briefly during submission

‚ùå **FAIL**: Multiple duplicate tasks appear (2 or more)
‚ùå **FAIL**: No task appears
‚ùå **FAIL**: Either method bypassed the guard

### Cleanup:
- Delete the test task: Click the task ‚Üí click "Verwijderen" button in popup

---

## Test Scenario 4: Slow Network Conditions

**Objective**: Verify that the guard remains active during slow network responses

### Steps:
1. **Throttle network** (Chrome DevTools):
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Change throttling dropdown from "No throttling" to "Slow 3G"
2. Click in the task input field at the top of the Inbox
3. Type: `Test slow network`
4. Press Enter once
5. **Immediately press Enter 3 more times** while loading indicator is still visible
6. Wait for loading indicator to disappear (may take 5-10 seconds on Slow 3G)

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ **PASS**: Only ONE task "Test slow network" appears in the inbox list
‚úÖ **PASS**: Loading overlay remained visible for ~5-10 seconds
‚úÖ **PASS**: Additional Enter presses during loading were ignored
‚úÖ **PASS**: Button remained disabled during entire loading period

‚ùå **FAIL**: Multiple duplicate tasks appear
‚ùå **FAIL**: Additional submissions were accepted during loading

### Cleanup:
- Delete the test task
- **Reset network throttling**: Change back to "No throttling" in DevTools

## Test Scenario 5: Submission After Previous Completion

**Objective**: Verify that the guard is properly released after successful submission, allowing new tasks

### Steps:
1. Click in the task input field at the top of the Inbox
2. Type: `First task`
3. Press Enter
4. Wait for loading indicator to disappear (~1 second)
5. Type: `Second task`
6. Press Enter
7. Wait for loading indicator to disappear (~1 second)

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ **PASS**: TWO separate tasks appear in the inbox list:
   - "First task"
   - "Second task"
‚úÖ **PASS**: Both submissions were accepted (guard was released after first)
‚úÖ **PASS**: No error messages appeared

‚ùå **FAIL**: Second submission was blocked
‚ùå **FAIL**: Only one task appears
‚ùå **FAIL**: Guard remained permanently active

### Cleanup:
- Delete both test tasks

---

## Test Scenario 6: Enter Key Held Down (Autorepeat)

**Objective**: Verify that holding Enter (keyboard autorepeat) only creates one task

### Steps:
1. Click in the task input field at the top of the Inbox
2. Type: `Test enter autorepeat`
3. **Hold down the Enter key** for 2-3 seconds (keyboard autorepeat will fire multiple keypress events)
4. Release Enter key
5. Wait for loading indicator to disappear

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ **PASS**: Only ONE task "Test enter autorepeat" appears in the inbox list
‚úÖ **PASS**: Autorepeat events were blocked by the guard

‚ùå **FAIL**: Multiple duplicate tasks appear
‚ùå **FAIL**: No task appears

### Cleanup:
- Delete the test task

---

## Test Scenario 7: Error Handling (Guard Release on Failure)

**Objective**: Verify that the guard is released even if submission fails

### Steps:
1. **Simulate network error**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Click "Offline" checkbox to disconnect
2. Click in the task input field at the top of the Inbox
3. Type: `Test error handling`
4. Press Enter
5. Wait for error message to appear (~5 seconds timeout)
6. **Re-enable network**: Uncheck "Offline" in DevTools
7. Press Enter again (same input field, should still have "Test error handling" text)

### Expected Result:
‚úÖ **PASS**: First submission shows error toast message
‚úÖ **PASS**: Second submission (after network restored) succeeds and creates the task
‚úÖ **PASS**: Guard was properly released after first failure
‚úÖ **PASS**: No permanent blocking of submissions

‚ùå **FAIL**: Guard remained active after error, blocking subsequent attempts
‚ùå **FAIL**: No error message shown
‚ùå **FAIL**: Second attempt still blocked

### Cleanup:
- Delete the test task (if created)
- **Reset network**: Ensure "Offline" is unchecked in DevTools

## Visual Feedback Verification

During ANY of the above test scenarios, verify these visual states:

### During Submission (Loading State):
‚úÖ Global loading overlay visible (semi-transparent background)
‚úÖ Loading spinner visible in overlay
‚úÖ Loading text: "Taak toevoegen..." visible
‚úÖ "Toevoegen" button has reduced opacity (~0.6)
‚úÖ "Toevoegen" button cursor changes to "not-allowed" on hover

### After Submission Complete:
‚úÖ Global loading overlay disappears
‚úÖ "Toevoegen" button returns to normal opacity (1.0)
‚úÖ "Toevoegen" button cursor returns to normal pointer
‚úÖ Input field is cleared and focused
‚úÖ Success toast appears: "Taak toegevoegd!"
‚úÖ New task appears in inbox list

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Multiple tasks still created despite guard
**Possible Causes**:
- Guard check not properly implemented in both event handlers
- operationId mismatch between guard check and `withLoading()` call
- Race condition in LoadingManager state management

**Debug Steps**:
1. Open Chrome DevTools Console
2. Look for console.log statements in `voegTaakToe()`
3. Check if multiple "üöÄ Sending task to server" logs appear
4. Verify `loading.isOperationActive('add-task')` returns correct boolean

### Issue: Guard never releases (submissions permanently blocked)
**Possible Causes**:
- Error in `withLoading()` finally block
- operationId not properly removed from activeOperations Set
- Exception thrown before `endOperation()` called

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check Chrome DevTools Console for JavaScript errors
2. Manually call `loading.activeOperations.clear()` in console to reset
3. Verify `withLoading()` has proper try/finally structure

### Issue: Button disabled state doesn't appear
**Possible Causes**:
- CSS class not properly defined in styles.css
- Class not properly added/removed in event handler
- CSS selector specificity issue

**Debug Steps**:
1. Inspect button element in Chrome DevTools
2. Verify `.disabled` class is added during submission
3. Check computed styles for opacity and pointer-events values

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Feature Ready for Production** when:
- All 7 test scenarios pass consistently
- Visual feedback works as expected
- No duplicate tasks created under any condition
- Guard properly releases after success and error states
- Performance is imperceptible (<5ms overhead per submission)

**Testing Complete**: Document results and proceed to deployment or bug fixing as needed.
