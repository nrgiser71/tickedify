# Feature Specification: Admin2 Delete User Account Bug Fix

**Feature Branch**: `021-in-admin2-in`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "In admin2, in User Management, heb ik geklikt op een user en heb ik daarna op de Delete User Account geklikt. Er wordt mij een aantal keer bevestiging gevraagd, maar het verwijderen geeft fouten. Dit is wat er in de console staat:admin2.js:20  DELETE https://tickedify.com/api/admin2/users/user_1760531416053_qwljhrwxp 400 (Bad Request) request @ admin2.js:20 deleteUser @ admin2.js:67 deleteUser @ admin2.js:1791 onclick @ admin2.html:1242Understand this error admin2.js:35 API Error (/users/user_1760531416053_qwljhrwxp): Error: User ID must be a positive number at Object.request (admin2.js:30:23) at async Object.deleteUser (admin2.js:1791:28)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature type: BUG FIX
   ’ Component: Admin2 User Management
   ’ Error: User ID validation failing for string format user IDs
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actor: Admin user
   ’ Action: Delete user account
   ’ Current behavior: 400 Bad Request with "User ID must be a positive number"
   ’ User ID format: user_1760531416053_qwljhrwxp (string format)
   ’ API endpoint: DELETE /api/admin2/users/{userId}
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects clear from error message
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flow identified: Admin ’ User Management ’ Select User ’ Delete Account
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ All requirements testable and clear
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ User entity with string-format user ID
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ’ No implementation details (focusing on behavior)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An administrator needs to delete a user account from the Admin2 User Management interface. After navigating to User Management, selecting a specific user, and clicking the "Delete User Account" button, the system should successfully delete the user after appropriate confirmation prompts. Currently, the deletion fails with a validation error claiming the user ID is not a positive number, even though the user ID is in the correct string format (e.g., `user_1760531416053_qwljhrwxp`).

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an administrator is viewing the User Management section in Admin2, **When** they select a user and click "Delete User Account" and confirm the deletion prompts, **Then** the user account should be successfully deleted without validation errors
2. **Given** a user ID in string format (e.g., `user_1760531416053_qwljhrwxp`), **When** the delete operation is initiated, **Then** the system should correctly handle the string format user ID and proceed with deletion
3. **Given** the deletion is successful, **When** the administrator returns to the User Management list, **Then** the deleted user should no longer appear in the list

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user ID format changes or contains unexpected characters?
- How does the system handle concurrent deletion attempts on the same user?
- What happens if a user is deleted while they have active sessions or data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept user IDs in string format (pattern: `user_[timestamp]_[alphanumeric]`) for delete operations
- **FR-002**: System MUST successfully delete user accounts when the correct user ID format is provided
- **FR-003**: System MUST display appropriate confirmation prompts before executing account deletion
- **FR-004**: System MUST return clear success or error messages after deletion attempts
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate user ID format correctly, distinguishing between legacy numeric IDs and current string format IDs
- **FR-006**: System MUST remove all traces of the deleted user from the User Management interface after successful deletion

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Identified by a unique user ID in string format (`user_[timestamp]_[alphanumeric]`), can be deleted by administrators through the Admin2 interface
- **Admin User**: Has permissions to access User Management and delete user accounts
