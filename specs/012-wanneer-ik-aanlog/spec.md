# Feature Specification: Admin Login Persistence

**Feature Branch**: `012-wanneer-ik-aanlog`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "Wanneer ik aanlog op de admin pagina en refresh, dan moet ik het paswoord opnieuw invullen. Telkens ik refresh moet ik het paswoord opnieuw invullen. Dat is niet OK. Onthoud dat ik ben aangelogd."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an admin, I log in to the admin page to access administrative functionality. When I refresh the page or navigate back to it, I should remain logged in and not be prompted to enter my credentials again during my active session.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an admin has successfully logged in with valid credentials, **When** they refresh the admin page, **Then** they should remain authenticated and see the admin interface without being prompted to log in again
2. **Given** an admin is logged in to the admin page, **When** they navigate away and return to the admin page within their session, **Then** they should still be logged in
3. **Given** an admin has logged in, **When** 24 hours have elapsed since authentication, **Then** their session should expire and they should be prompted to log in again
4. **Given** an admin closes the browser after logging in, **When** they reopen the browser and navigate to the admin page within 24 hours, **Then** they should still be authenticated without needing to log in again
5. **Given** an admin is actively using the admin page, **When** their 24-hour session expires, **Then** the system should prompt them to re-authenticate

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the admin's session expires while they are actively using the admin page? (System should notify and redirect to login)
- How does the system handle concurrent logins from the same admin account on different devices/browsers? (Multiple concurrent sessions should be allowed)
- What happens if the admin manually clears their browser data while logged in? (Session is lost, admin must re-authenticate)
- What happens if the admin tries to access the admin page with an expired session token? (System validates and redirects to login prompt)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST persist admin authentication state across page refreshes within the same browser session
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain admin login state when the admin navigates away from and returns to the admin page
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically authenticate returning admins without requiring password re-entry if their session is still valid
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist admin sessions across browser restarts (sessions survive browser closure)
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate the authenticity of persisted authentication state before granting access to admin functionality
- **FR-006**: System MUST expire sessions after 24 hours from the time of authentication
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a way for admins to explicitly log out and invalidate their session
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle invalid or expired authentication gracefully by redirecting to the login prompt
- **FR-009**: System MUST notify admins when their session expires while actively using the admin page

### Key Entities
- **Admin Session**: Represents an authenticated admin's active connection, includes authentication state, expiry time, and session identifier
- **Admin Credentials**: The authentication information used to verify admin identity (currently password-based)

## Notes
**Primary Issue**: The admin page currently does not retain authentication state between page refreshes, forcing the admin to re-enter credentials repeatedly. This creates a poor user experience and reduces productivity for administrative tasks.

**Design Decisions**:
1. **Session Duration**: 24 hours from authentication time
2. **Persistence**: Sessions survive browser restarts (not just browser session cookies)
3. **Remember Me**: Not required - standard 24-hour persistence is sufficient
4. **Security Level**: Focus on user convenience - admin functions are not highly sensitive

**Security Considerations**: While not implementation details, the solution must ensure that persisting authentication state does not create security vulnerabilities (session hijacking, XSS attacks, etc.).
